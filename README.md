# wright-catalogue
This repository stores the project files for the Fall 2019 phase of the encoding of William Wright's Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum acquired since the year 1838 (London: Gilbert and Rivington, 1870-1872). There are digitized files containing the contents of Wright's catalogue under the directory "Wright Word Documents".

However, the majority of this repository consists of an oXygen XML Project file and associated paramater data. This data includes the TEI-derived Syriaca schema as well as a CSS file used to style oXygen's Author mode. The 'data' directory contains the encoded entries of Wright's catalogue themselves.

Note: wright.xpr This is an oxygen project file and should be opened the first time editors begin to work in Oxygen.
